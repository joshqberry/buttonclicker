may have to use ruby version 1.9.3 to make this work.

Huh, so it appears that not precompiling my assets (by adding the assets.rake file and
the interior code) doesn't stop my app from running locally... but it does slow it
DOWN a fair bit. It's now not always registering clicks; and also, the outpput in the
terminal is decidedly slower. In fact, sometimes the click registers on the webpage but
NOT in the terminal. Strange.
... No, maybe that's not the issue. My computer is moving slowly suddenly. Apparently
because of all the Heroku push attempts I just made, although I don't understand why
that'd be an issue... Seems to be an issue only with the button; using the in-page
button works fine. Hope I didn't overload my Arduino...
... well, I unplugged it, stopped Rails server, re-plugged it back in, re-started Rails
server and all is well again...

... However, the addition of that assets.rake file did not fix the Heroku-push error.

... oh, wait, I THINK stuff has to be pushed to GitHub first, then to Heroku. I think
you're supposed to be able to skip the GitHub step, but maybe I'm configured for to
require that.
