may have to use ruby version 1.9.3 to make this work.

Huh, so it appears that not precompiling my assets (by adding the assets.rake file and
the interior code) doesn't stop my app from running locally... but it does slow it
DOWN a fair bit. It's now not always registering clicks; and also, the outpput in the
terminal is decidedly slower. In fact, sometimes the click registers on the webpage but
NOT in the terminal. Strange.
... No, maybe that's not the issue. My computer is moving slowly suddenly. Apparently
because of all the Heroku push attempts I just made, although I don't understand why
that'd be an issue... Seems to be an issue only with the button; using the in-page
button works fine. Hope I didn't overload my Arduino...
... well, I unplugged it, stopped Rails server, re-plugged it back in, re-started Rails
server and all is well again...

... However, the addition of that assets.rake file did not fix the Heroku-push error.

... oh, wait, I THINK stuff has to be pushed to GitHub first, then to Heroku. I think
you're supposed to be able to skip the GitHub step, but maybe I'm configured for to
require that.

... Huh, that did it. I STILL got the error saying that the rake had been aborted, and
that I had an unitialized constant YAML... and yet the deploy was complete, apparently.
Now, though, can I use this app via Heroku, or did I just block something that was
necessary to have?

Well, can't even see Heroku page for now... page said error occurred in application.
Thought it might be a database issue. Tried to migrate database, it wouldn't let me...

Hmm, I wonder if that's an issue with using Pusher.

Well, someone on the internets told me, and maybe I knew this, I dunno, that you DON'T
do a Heroku db:create. It won't let you. You instead to a db:migrate.

OK, so next issue is back to same I've seen before: unintialized constant YAML. So
neither a push nor a db:migrate will work till I've fixed this issue.

OK, so, added the 'dotenv' gem, and a ".env" file with the pusher stuff in it, and
added the ".env" file to the gitignore file. App still working locally, athough
seems to be moving slower. Could be an issue other than that of the code changes,
though...

... Actually, the "moving slower" thing was due to the connection loosening... that was
an easy fix, although not the first thing I thought of...

Fiddled with moving things around more, in order to make pusher.yaml file "viewable" by
Heroku, and was able to push to Heroku once more... BUT still saw same error of
'unitialized constant yaml.' So... yep, still can't open Heroku page.
